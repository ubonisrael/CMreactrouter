## Overview

### Summary

A CRUD web app built with ReactJS that allows users to add, edit, store and delete contacts.

### Features

Users can add, edit, delete and search for contacts.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- TailwindCSS
- Typescript
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [ReactRouter](https://reactrouter.com/en/main) - JS library
- Firebase
- Version Control: Git
- Hosting: Vercel

### Project, Purpose and Goal

The main purpose of this project is to get more acquainted with typescript, reactrouter and tailwind.It is a modification of a previous [project](https://github.com/ubonisrael/contact-manager-app) that was built with vanilla javascript, react and plain CSS. 

### What I learned

This was my first time attempting to build a project with reactrouter and tailwind and a project more complex than previous attempts with typescript. I learned how to apply cascading styles, dark mode and custom styles using tailwind, route the application to different sections and explore the framework capabilities of react router and avoid errors and bugs using typescript.

### Continued development

I would love to continue exploring the frameworks used in this project and get more comfortable with writing code with them.

### Future improvements

- ~~Allow users to delete multiple contact at once.~~
- Add toasts to indicate when an action, e.g adding a contact has been successfully achieved.
- Create Merge and Fix functionality.
- Create a favorites page.
- Allow users to be able to import contacts.

### Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequistes

1. Create a Firebase account (if you don't have one already), and create a new project. On the Firebase Console, set up the project by adding Cloud Storage feature and copy the firebase Config from the project settings, you'll need it to initialize firebase on your app.

2. Create a config folder and firebase config then export them to where you want to use them (alternatively, you can create an .env.local in the root of your directory and add them there.)

#### Installing

Clone the repository and run the development server:

```
npm install
npm run dev

// or

yarn install
yarn dev
```
